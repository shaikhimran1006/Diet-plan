## 🔬 How Meals Are Generated

### Algorithm:
1. **Calculate macro targets** (BMR × activity × goal adjustment)
2. **Distribute macros** across 4 meals (25%, 35%, 30%, 10%)
3. **Select foods** based on:
   - Meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)
   - Dietary preferences
   - Allergen restrictions
4. **Calculate portions** to hit macro targets
5. **Randomize** food selection for variety

### Example Calculation:
```python
Target: 2500 kcal, 180g protein, 280g carbs, 80g fats

Breakfast (625 kcal, 45g P, 70g C, 20g F):
- Protein: 150g Eggs (45g P) ✓
- Carbs: 80g Oatmeal (53g C) + 50g Banana (12g C) ✓
- Fats: 15g Almonds (7.5g F) + 10g Olive Oil (10g F) ✓
- Vegetables: 150g Spinach (4g C)
```
