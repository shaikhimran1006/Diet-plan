## 🎯 Prediction Capabilities

### 1. Weight Trend Prediction

**What it does:**
- Analyzes weight history using linear regression
- Predicts weight at 7, 14, and 30 days in the future
- Calculates trend direction (increasing/decreasing/stable)
- Provides confidence score based on data consistency

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "trend": "decreasing",
  "weekly_change": -0.5,
  "predictions": {
    "7_days": 69.5,
    "14_days": 69.0,
    "30_days": 68.0
  },
  "confidence": 87.3,
  "current_weight": 70.0
}
```

**Endpoint:** `GET /predictions/weight/{user_id}`

---

### 2. Intelligent Calorie Adjustment

**What it does:**
- Calculates TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
- Adjusts recommendations based on actual progress
- Compares expected vs actual weight change
- Provides dynamic calorie targets

**How it works:**
```
IF goal = "weight_loss" AND actual_loss < expected:
    → Reduce calories by 100
IF goal = "weight_loss" AND actual_loss > expected:
    → Increase calories by 100 (prevent too-fast loss)
IF goal = "muscle_gain" AND not gaining:
    → Increase calories by 150
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "current_tdee": 2200,
  "recommended_calories": 1800,
  "adjustment": -100,
  "reason": "Progress slower than expected - reducing calories",
  "weekly_target": -0.5
}
```

**Endpoint:** `GET /predictions/calories/{user_id}`

---

### 3. Hydration Needs Prediction

**What it does:**
- Calculates water needs based on body weight
- Adjusts for activity level
- Provides timing recommendations

**Formula:**
```
Base water (ml) = Weight (kg) × 35ml
Activity adjustment:
  - Sedentary: +0ml
  - Light: +250ml
  - Moderate: +500ml
  - Active: +750ml
  - Very Active: +1000ml

Glasses = Total ml ÷ 250ml
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "daily_ml": 2450,
  "daily_glasses": 10,
  "timing": [
    "Upon waking: 1-2 glasses",
    "Before lunch: 1 glass",
    "Afternoon: 1-2 glasses",
    "With dinner: 1 glass",
    "Evening: 1 glass"
  ]
}
```

---

### 4. Exercise Adherence Analysis

**What it does:**
- Calculates workout consistency percentage
- Identifies preferred workout duration
- Provides motivational recommendations

**Logic:**
```python
adherence_rate = (days_exercised / 7) × 100

IF adherence > 80%:
    "Excellent! Consider increasing intensity"
ELIF adherence > 50%:
    "Good progress! Try to add one more session"
ELSE:
    "Start small - aim for 3 days per week"
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "adherence_rate": 71.4,
  "best_time": "morning",
  "preferred_duration": 35,
  "recommendation": "Good progress! Try to add one more session"
}
```

---

### 5. Meal Timing Optimization

**What it does:**
- Recommends optimal meal timing based on goals
- Adjusts for muscle gain (frequent meals) vs weight loss (fewer meals)
- Provides science-based timing windows

**Goal-Based Timing:**

**Muscle Gain:**
- Breakfast: 07:00 AM
- Snack 1: 10:00 AM
- Lunch: 12:30 PM
- Snack 2: 03:30 PM
- Dinner: 06:30 PM
- Post-workout: Within 30 min

**Weight Loss:**
- Breakfast: 08:00 AM
- Lunch: 01:00 PM
- Snack: 04:00 PM
- Dinner: 07:00 PM

---

### 6. Plateau Risk Detection

**What it does:**
- Analyzes weight variance over 14 days
- Detects early signs of plateau
- Provides actionable solutions

**Detection Logic:**
```python
weight_variance = Σ(weight - avg)² / n

IF variance < 0.5:
    Risk: HIGH
    "Consider calorie cycling or changing workout"
ELIF variance < 1.0:
    Risk: MODERATE
    "Monitor closely, may need adjustments soon"
ELSE:
    Risk: LOW
    "Good progress, continue current plan"
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "risk_level": "moderate",
  "recommendation": "Monitor closely, may need adjustments soon",
  "variance": 0.8
}
```

---

### 7. Macro Distribution Optimization

**What it does:**
- Calculates optimal protein/carbs/fats ratio
- Adjusts based on goals and performance

**Goal-Based Distributions:**
```
Weight Loss:     35% protein, 35% carbs, 30% fats
Muscle Gain:     30% protein, 45% carbs, 25% fats
Maintenance:     25% protein, 45% carbs, 30% fats
Endurance:       20% protein, 55% carbs, 25% fats
```

---

### 8. Success Probability Calculator

**What it does:**
- Predicts likelihood of reaching goals
- Factors: exercise adherence, diet consistency, logging frequency
- Provides specific improvement recommendations

**Calculation:**
```python
factors = [
    exercise_adherence / 100,
    diet_adherence / 100,
    logging_consistency / 100
]

probability = (sum(factors) / len(factors)) × 100

IF probability > 80:
    "Excellent! You're on track"
ELIF probability > 60:
    "Good progress! Small improvements will help"
ELIF probability > 40:
    "Need more consistency"
ELSE:
    "Consider reassessing your approach"
```

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "success_probability": 72.5,
  "insight": "Good progress! Small improvements will help",
  "key_factors": [
    "Increase exercise frequency",
    "Improve diet adherence"

## 📊 How It Works - Technical Details

### Linear Regression for Weight Prediction

```python
# Simple linear regression on weight data
n = len(weights)
daily_change = (last_weight - first_weight) / days_span

# Future prediction
future_weight = current_weight + (daily_change × days)
```

### Trend Detection Algorithm

```python
# Calculate variance
avg_weight = sum(weights) / len(weights)
variance = sum((w - avg) ** 2 for w in weights) / len(weights)

# Determine trend
if abs(weekly_change) < 0.1:
    trend = "stable"
elif weekly_change < 0:
    trend = "decreasing"
else:
    trend = "increasing"
```

### Confidence Score Calculation

```python
# Based on data consistency (lower variance = higher confidence)
confidence = max(0, min(100, 100 - (variance × 10)))
```

```javascript
// Get comprehensive predictions
const fetchPredictions = async (userId) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `http://localhost:8000/predictions/comprehensive/${userId}`
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  
  // Display weight prediction
  console.log(`Predicted weight in 30 days: ${data.predictions.weight_prediction.predictions['30_days']} kg`);
  
  // Show recommendations
  console.log(`Recommended calories: ${data.predictions.calorie_prediction.recommended_calories}`);
  
  // Success probability

## 🎯 Accuracy & Limitations

### What Makes It Accurate

✅ **Scientific Formulas**: BMR calculations use peer-reviewed Mifflin-St Jeor equation  
✅ **Evidence-Based**: Calorie math based on thermodynamics (7700 cal = 1kg)  
✅ **Data-Driven**: More historical data = better predictions  
✅ **Adaptive**: Adjusts recommendations based on real results  

### Limitations

⚠️ **Requires Data**: Needs at least 7-14 days of logs for accurate predictions  
⚠️ **Individual Variation**: Metabolism varies by person  
⚠️ **Linear Assumptions**: Assumes consistent behavior patterns  
⚠️ **Not Medical Advice**: Should not replace professional healthcare guidance  

### Improving Accuracy

To get better predictions:
1. **Log daily** - More data points = better trends
2. **Be consistent** - Regular logging improves pattern recognition
3. **Track everything** - Weight, calories, exercise, hydration
4. **Wait 2+ weeks** - Short-term fluctuations are normal

---

## 🔬 Scientific Basis

### BMR Calculation (Mifflin-St Jeor)

**For Men:**
```
BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) + 5
```

**For Women:**
```
BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) - (5 × age) - 161
```

### TDEE Multipliers

Based on research from the American Council on Exercise:
- Sedentary: BMR × 1.2
- Light activity: BMR × 1.375
- Moderate activity: BMR × 1.55
- Active: BMR × 1.725
- Very active: BMR × 1.9

### Weight Change Mathematics

**Scientific constant:**
- 1 kg of body fat = 7,700 calories

**To lose 0.5 kg per week:**
```
Daily deficit = 7700 ÷ 7 ÷ 2 = 550 calories
```
