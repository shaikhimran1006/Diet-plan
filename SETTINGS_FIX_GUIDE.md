# Settings Integration - Complete Fix Guide

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
The Settings page was only updating local React state without saving to the database. This meant:
- Changes weren't persisted
- Predictions didn't update when profile changed
- BMR/calorie calculations remained outdated

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Backend Endpoints Added (main.py)
```python
# GET /user/{user_id} - Fetch user profile
# PUT /user/{user_id} - Update profile with auto BMR recalculation
```

#### 2. Settings.jsx Updated
**Added:**
- ✅ Data fetching on page load (`useEffect` + `fetchUserData`)
- ✅ Real-time API integration with axios
- ✅ Loading states (initial load + saving)
- ✅ Success/error messages with styled alerts
- ✅ Automatic BMR recalculation on save
- ✅ Updated daily calorie goals after profile changes

**New Features:**
- Loading spinner while fetching data
- Disabled save button during API call
- Real-time feedback with success/error messages
- BMR and recommended calories displayed in success message

#### 3. Predictions.jsx Enhanced
**Added:**
- ✅ Refresh button with loading animation
- ✅ Manual refresh capability
- ✅ Refreshing state indicator

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test Scenario 1: Settings Load
1. Open http://localhost:5174 (or 5173)
2. Navigate to **Settings** page
3. ✅ Should see loading spinner briefly
4. ✅ Form should populate with actual user data from database

### Test Scenario 2: Save Profile Changes
1. In Settings, change values:
   - Age: 30 → 35
   - Weight: 70 → 75
   - Activity Level: moderate → active
2. Click **Save Changes**
3. ✅ Button should show "Saving..." with spinner
4. ✅ Success message appears with:
   - "Settings saved!"
   - New BMR value
   - New recommended calories

### Test Scenario 3: Predictions Update
1. After saving settings, go to **Predictions** page
2. Click **Refresh** button
3. ✅ Should see "Refreshing..." with spinning icon
4. ✅ Predictions should update based on new profile:
   - Weight forecast adjusted
   - Calorie recommendations changed
   - Success probability recalculated

### Test Scenario 4: Error Handling
1. Stop backend server (Ctrl+C in backend terminal)
2. Try to save settings
3. ✅ Should see error message: "Failed to save settings"
4. ✅ Save button re-enables

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Flow
```
Settings Page:
1. Page Load → GET /user/1 → Display current data
2. User edits → Local state update (instant feedback)
3. Save button → PUT /user/1 → Backend recalculates BMR
4. Success → Display new BMR + calories
```

### Auto-Calculations on Backend
When you update profile via PUT /user/{user_id}:
```python
# Backend automatically:
1. Calculates new BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor formula)
2. Calculates TDEE based on activity level
3. Applies deficit/surplus for health goal
4. Returns updated metrics in response
```

### Activity Level Multipliers
- **Sedentary**: 1.2x BMR
- **Light**: 1.375x BMR
- **Moderate**: 1.55x BMR
- **Active**: 1.725x BMR
- **Very Active**: 1.9x BMR

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix
- Settings changes: ❌ Not saved
- Predictions: ❌ Always same (outdated data)
- BMR: ❌ Never recalculated

### After Fix
- Settings changes: ✅ Saved to database
- Predictions: ✅ Update with refresh button
- BMR: ✅ Auto-recalculated on profile update

## 🎯 Example Test Data

### Initial State (User ID 1)
```json
{
  "age": 25,
  "gender": "male",
  "height": 175,
  "weight": 70,
  "activity_level": "moderate"
}
```
**Expected BMR:** ~1700 cal
**Expected TDEE:** ~2635 cal (1700 × 1.55)

### After Change
```json
{
  "age": 30,
  "gender": "male",
  "height": 175,
  "weight": 75,
  "activity_level": "active"
}
```
**Expected BMR:** ~1780 cal
**Expected TDEE:** ~3071 cal (1780 × 1.725)

## 🚀 Quick Verification Steps

1. **Backend Running?**
   ```
   ✓ http://localhost:8000/docs (should show API docs)
   ```

2. **Frontend Running?**
   ```
   ✓ http://localhost:5174 (or 5173)
   ```

3. **Test Settings Save:**
   ```
   1. Settings → Change weight to 80
   2. Click Save
   3. Should see: "Settings saved! New BMR: XXXX cal, Recommended: XXXX cal/day"
   ```

4. **Test Predictions Refresh:**
   ```
   1. Predictions → Click Refresh
   2. Should see updated weight forecast
   3. Calorie recommendations should match new profile
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to save settings"
**Solution:** Check backend is running on port 8000

### Issue: Form shows default values (25, 70, etc.)
**Solution:** Backend returned error. Check:
- Database file exists: `backend/diet_fitness.db`
- User ID 1 exists in database

### Issue: Predictions don't change after save
**Solution:** Click the **Refresh** button on Predictions page

### Issue: Port 5173 in use
**Solution:** Frontend started on 5174 instead (automatic)
